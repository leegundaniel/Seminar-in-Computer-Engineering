- Accelerometer / Gyroscope
- Mobile Devices (Smartphone/Tablet)
- Vehicle Computer

### Categories of VIoT Services
1. Safety & Regulation
    - Road Condition Monitoring
    - Driving Hazard Detection
    - Pedestrian Monitoring
2. Data Service
    - Location-Based Service (12V)
    - Data Upload (V2I)
    - Web Browsing, Email, etc.
3. Driving Efficiency
    - Smart Road Navigation
    - Smart Road Traffic Control
    - Green Vehicle Speed Control

### Proposed Solution & Challenges for VIoT
> Analysis of sensing data from a 3D acceleromenter.
> Integrated data from a crowd of taxis.

- Low Cost
    - 3G/4G-LTE/DSRC/WiFi Communications
- High Accuracy
    - Aggregated data from number of taxis
- Continuous Coverage
    - In both time and space

#### Road Condition Monitoring
#### Participatory Crowd Monitoring
- A driver can trigger the external camera to report the violations such as hit and run, crossing solid lines.

### Vehicular Communications for VIoT
1. Infrastructure-to-Vehicle Communications (I2V)
    - Vehicle requests to road network
    - road network send request to cloud
    - cloud provides response
    - road network gives data in the next network unit
2. Vehicle-to-Vehicle Communications (V2V)
    - Vehicle detects activity (e.g., aquaplaning)
    - send information to nearby vehicle
    - other vehicles nearby will receive information and data
